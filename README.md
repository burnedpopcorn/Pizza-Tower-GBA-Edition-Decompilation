# Pizza Tower GBA Edition Decompilation
 A Decompilation of Pizza Tower GBA Edtion V2

This Decompilation is Finished, and will most likely not be worked on

## Inportant Information
> Only here for the people that really care about a pure decompilation

- The Original GMS Version according to UTMT was GMS2.3, but I have updated it to the GMS2 2022.2 LTS
- The Project Icon has been changed from stock
- All Sounds have been changed to be Compressed and Embedded into the data.win
- Windows, GX.GAMES, and HTML Exports have been tested and do work

> All tested Exports has had their Settings tweaked to replace stock information

- The Windows Export has had its Settings tweaked to be faithful to the Original Executable

> GX.GAMES Export is recommended, as HTML is slower and the Canvas is smaller

### Thanks to
- Whoever made the Original Pizza Tower GBA Edition
- QuantumV, for his GMS2 decompiler

### Also
This GMS2 Project is not organized with Internal Folders

It isn't really worth my time, especially since GMS Search is really good, and there's barely any assets anyways

So Cry about it
